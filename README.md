# Uheer: Android client

## Introduction
A Uheer client for Android platforms.


## Next steps
We have 2 empty activities that work as a complete independent app, so they are modules to be implemented the below features:

+ Show list of contacts from user's phone that are in the same place.
+ Show list of contacts from the user's phone that are in other places and its distance in Km.

New developers must create this functionalities in these activities with data being received from the server artificially, i.e. create a list of emails that matches with emails from your phone in the first task and a list of emails and gps localizations for the second.
